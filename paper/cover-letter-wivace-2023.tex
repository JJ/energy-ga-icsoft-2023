Dear sirs:\\

This is a cover letter for the submission of the final version of the paper
"Energy consumption of evolutionary algorithms in JavaScript", which was presented in the WIVACE 2023 conference in Venice. This is a list of the changes made to the original submission.\begin{itemize}
\item The original paper was a full paper, so no major extension has been added;
  it keeps its original length of 12 pages.
\item The comments made by the reviewers have also been addressed:\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reviewer 1: Grammar should be revised}: A very extensive
    revision of grammar has been performed, changing most paragraphs on the
    paper; this has been made with the help of professional writing software.
  \item \textbf{Reviewer 2: Incorporate and mention previous work}: in the
    original paper presented in the conference, the previous paper in this line
    of work had not been published yet; the conference proceedings (for ICSoft
    2023) have now been published, and the correct reference is now included and
    correctly qualified in the paper.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

Hope all these changes make it fit for publication. Yours\\
