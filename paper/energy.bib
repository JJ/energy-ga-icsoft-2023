Microprocessors are the ``brains'' of computing systems -- they contain the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to execute instructions, process data, and run sophisticated software programs. With the most advanced personal computing microprocessors today containing over 100 billion transistors, system complexity and design challenges have never been greater (Apple Newsroom, 2022). To overcome such challenges, design leaders must pay close attention to both Micro- and Macro-architectural decisions, carefully balancing the trade-offs between flexibility and performance with the cost and complexity of system tighter integration. In this chapter, we will analyze the architectural decisions and trade-offs these leaders face as they build the next generation of electronic devices.",

abstract = {Developing green and sustainable software has become a prominent topic in research over the last years. While approaches are being constantly researched and developed to estimate and in turn optimize the energy consumption of software applications, there is still a lack of knowledge amongst practitioners how to address energy consumption as an important non-functional quality aspect and in turn develop sustainable software. By providing a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art in mobile software energy consumption, we want to examine how research has contributed to fill this gap in knowledge over the last decade, by providing the foundations to estimate mobile software energy consumption. Therefore, we categorize available work amongst the approach taken to profile energy consumption, the individual contributions and the intended platform of use. Furthermore, we examine the availability of tools and frameworks for research and practice. The foundation for this review is a systematically collected selection of 134 studies published in between 2011 till 2021. From the data synthesised from the selected studies, we discuss key observations and future ongoing challenges in mobile software, energy consumption profiling. Furthermore, we believe that the key for a broad adoption is a common terminology. Henceforth, we propose an ontology describing mobile software energy consumption profiling from the results obtained in the presented review.}

abstract = {Measuring the energy consumption of software components is a major building block for generating models that allow for energy-aware scheduling, accounting and budgeting. Current measurement techniques focus on coarse-grained measurements of application or system events. However, fine grain adjustments in particular in the operating-system kernel and in application-level servers require power profiles at the level of a single software function. Until recently, this appeared to be impossible due to the lacking fine grain resolution and high costs of measurement equipment. In this paper we report on our experience in using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy sensors available in recent Intel CPUs for measuring energy consumption of short code paths. We investigate the granularity at which RAPL measurements can be performed and discuss practical obstacles that occur when performing these measurements on complex modern CPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the RAPL infrastructure to characterize the energy costs for decoding video slices.},

abstract="Energy consumption is a matter of paramount importance in nowadays environmentally conscious society. It is also bound to be a crucial issue in light of the emergent computational environments arising from the pervasive use of networked handheld devices and wearables. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are ideally suited for this kind of environments due to their intrinsic flexibility and adaptiveness, provided they operate on viable energy terms. In this work we analyze the energy requirements of EAs, and particularly one of their main flavours, genetic programming (GP), on several computational platforms and study the impact that parametrisation has on these requirements, paving the way for a future generation of energy-aware EAs. As experimentally demonstrated, handheld devices and tiny computer models mainly used for educational purposes may be the most energy efficient ones when looking for solutions by means of EAs.",

abstract = {This paper compares a large set of programming languages regarding their efficiency, including from an energetic point-of-view. Indeed, we seek to establish and analyze different rankings for programming languages based on their energy efficiency. The goal of being able to rank programming languages based on their energy efficiency is both recent, and certainly deserves further studies. We have taken rigorous and strict solutions to 10 well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from the well known Computer Language Benchmark Game repository. This repository aims to compare programming languages based on a strict set of implementation rules and configurations for each benchmarking problem. We have also built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the energy, time, and memory efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparisons that we propose a series of efficiency rankings, based on single and multiple criteria. Our results show interesting findings, such as how slower/faster languages can consume less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also present a simple way to use our results to provide software engineers and practitioners support in deciding which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. In addition, we further validate our results and rankings against implementations from a chrestomathy program repository, Rosetta Code., by reproducing our methodology and benchmarking system. This allows us to understand how the results and conclusions from our rigorously and well defined benchmarked programs compare to those based on more representative and real-world implementations. Indeed our results show that the rankings do not change apart from one programming language.}
