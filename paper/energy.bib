abstract = {Energy consumption has been widely studied in the computer architecture field for decades. While the adoption of energy as a metric in machine learning is emerging, the majority of research is still primarily focused on obtaining high levels of accuracy without any computational constraint. We believe that one of the reasons for this lack of interest is due to their lack of familiarity with approaches to evaluate energy consumption. To address this challenge, we present a review of the different approaches to estimate energy consumption in general and machine learning applications in particular. Our goal is to provide useful guidelines to the machine learning community giving them the fundamental knowledge to use and build specific energy estimation methods for machine learning algorithms. We also present the latest software tools that give energy estimation values, together with two use cases that enhance the study of energy consumption in machine learning.}

abstract="Energy consumption is a matter of paramount importance in nowadays environmentally conscious society. It is also bound to be a crucial issue in light of the emergent computational environments arising from the pervasive use of networked handheld devices and wearables. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are ideally suited for this kind of environments due to their intrinsic flexibility and adaptiveness, provided they operate on viable energy terms. In this work we analyze the energy requirements of EAs, and particularly one of their main flavours, genetic programming (GP), on several computational platforms and study the impact that parametrisation has on these requirements, paving the way for a future generation of energy-aware EAs. As experimentally demonstrated, handheld devices and tiny computer models mainly used for educational purposes may be the most energy efficient ones when looking for solutions by means of EAs.",
